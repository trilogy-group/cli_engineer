## System Overview
The **cli_engineer** is a Rust-based, non-interactive CLI tool that leverages AI to automate coding tasks. It manages artifacts (e.g., code files, execution outputs), executes code in isolated environments, installs dependencies, maintains an artifact manifest, and provides a colorful terminal display with real-time feedback. The tool is designed for fully automated execution, relying on initial commands and configurations without requiring user interaction.

  - Forwards events to the Terminal UI Module and other components.

## Key Flows

### Artifact Management Flow
1. The **Task Orchestrator** initiates artifact creation or execution based on initial commands and configurations.
2. The **Artifact and Execution Manager**: 
   - Sets up an isolated environment and installs dependencies.
   - Executes code, validates outputs, and stores artifacts.
   - Updates the manifest and emits events.
3. The **Terminal UI Module** displays progress bars and the artifact manifest.

### Terminal Display Mechanism
1. Components emit events to the **Event Bus** (e.g., "context_usage", "api_cost").
2. The **Terminal UI Module** renders:
   - Color-coded sections ([Artifacts], [Execution], [Metrics]).
   - Progress bars for tasks.
   - Real-time metrics and manifest summary.

**Example Terminal Output**:
```
[Artifacts]
- main.py (created at 2025-05-16 16:34)
- output.txt (generated at 2025-05-16 16:35)

[Execution]
- Running task: [=====     ] 50% complete

[Metrics]
- Context Usage: 30% (3000/10000 tokens)
- API Cost: $0.05
- Run Time: 5 minutes
```
